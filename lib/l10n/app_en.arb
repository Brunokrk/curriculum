  "aboutContent": "My name is Bruno Marchi Pires, I'm 24 years old and currently live in Florianópolis. I have a degree in Computer Science from the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC). Here, in my portfolio, you will be able to better understand my academic and professional trajectory, learn about the projects I have worked on, as well as my ambitions and future goals. I'm always open to communication and you can contact me through any of the channels available here!",
  "graduationContent": "I have always had a great affinity with computers and ease with logical reasoning, which led me to enroll in the Computer Science bachelor's degree in 2018. Even without prior programming experience, the academic environment proved to be highly stimulating and challenging, providing broad and in-depth learning in various areas. During my academic journey, I acquired a solid foundation in programming with the C language and evolved to object orientation with Java. From there, I explored various areas, including data analysis, evolutionary algorithms, artificial intelligence and game development with Python. I also had contact with functional languages like Haskell, in addition to exploring Web development frameworks like Angular and React. I used some relational and non-relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB, beyond all the scope that is inherent to a good computer science course. Currently, I dedicate myself to developing mobile solutions with Dart and Flutter. I have always sought to maintain a broad and versatile view in the technology area, testing new frameworks and languages, believing that this facilitates continuous learning of new technologies and avoids exclusive dependence on a single language or framework in building effective solutions.",

  "bmptecContent": "I worked on the development of two white label applications marketed to hundreds of clients, participating in the entire development and maintenance cycle.\n\nMain activities:\n• Development with clean architecture, structured in layers (Data, Domain, Presentation).\n• Identification and correction of bugs in development and production environments.\n• Active participation in agile methodologies: refinements, code reviews, dailies and retrospectives.\n• Management of multiple applications in Google Play and App Store stores (white label model).\n• Contribution to technical discussions and decision-making about architecture and development patterns.\n\nTechnical responsibilities:\n• Use of different state managers, such as GetX and Provider.\n• Implementation of clean architecture (contracts, use cases, services, repositories, DTOs and models).\n• Creation and configuration of applications in Firebase.\n• Integration with native operating system resources (e.g.: camera).\n• Firebase Push Notifications configuration.\n• Writing unit tests.\n• Use of pipelines for partner publication in stores and maintenance of the same.\n• Creation of scripts for automation of manual team processes.",
  "totvsPosition": "FullStack Development Intern",
  "totvsContent": "In the context of a team focused on the international market, I played a significant role in customizing and creating software to meet the specific needs of corporate clients for the international market. As the team's main developer in the context of Web technologies, I worked on a large-scale project focused on technological modernization, which consisted of transforming traditional desktop programs into sophisticated web applications adapted for the international market.\n\nDuring this period, I substantially improved my skills in using Angular and AngularJS frameworks, applying programming languages such as TypeScript and HTML to develop robust and efficient solutions.\n\nMy experience also included API development using the Progress4GL language, which facilitated the integration of databases into the new web environment efficiently. Additionally, I had the opportunity to explore PO-UI, a proprietary graphical interface framework from the company, which is also made available for public use.\n\nThis set of skills and experiences not only enriched my technical repertoire, but also enabled a significant contribution to innovation in a large organization, highlighting the relevance and impact of my work.",
